# Installation

Installing the ImagePro is very easy: 

1. Download the package from http://www.zoolanders.com
2. Go to the Joomla Extensions Installer
3. Upload the previously downloaded package
4. Click Install

After this, the ImagePro should be installed and published. To be sure, go to ***Extensions / Plugin Manager*** and check if **ZLElements** is present and enabled.

### Quick Note 
*ImagePro is installed under the same plugin, **ZLElements**, as any other ZL Element, for perfomance reasons. If you want to check that ImagePro is correctly installed, visit the ZOO configuration, and edit a type. If ImagePro shows up on the right section, then you're good to go!*
