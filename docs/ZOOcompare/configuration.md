## ZOOcompare Chart
The compare chart is very flexible and allows you to not just set up the Data to be compare but Headers, Groups, Tools and more.

In the App *Extension Layouts* go to the *ZOOcompare Chart / Compare*. You will see two positions, *Rows* and *Toolbar*.

### Rows Position

In this position you can place any Element which data you would like to be displayed in the comparison Chart. Each Element has it's own Rendering options, be sure to set it up as needed. It could happen that the Element has no data, in that case an alternative text could be displayed using the "If no value, render instead* field under the ZOOcompare Section.

Additionally you can place the *Compare* Element there to render special rows such as *Main Header* and *Header* or even add custom ones. Each of them have it's configuration settings, be sure to check them up.

### Toolbar Position

In this position you can place only the *Compare* Element which will allow you to choose Toolbar buttons such as *Download CSV*, *Restore Chart* and *Restore Hidden*. Those are rendered in the Bottom of the Chart when using the Default Layout.
