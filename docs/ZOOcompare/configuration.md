# Configuration

## Step 1. Set up the Type
Please add the *Compare* element to the Type you would like to compare. If you are not familiar with this process please review the [official ZOO docs](http://www.yootheme.com/zoo/documentation/advanced/extend-pre-build-types).

## Step 2. Compare element assignment
The *Compare* element is used to display a button which will add the Item to the comparison list and usually you would set it in the App Teaser layout.

Assign the element to the desired layout positions and configure as needed. If you are not familiar with this process please review the [official ZOO docs](http://www.yootheme.com/zoo/documentation/advanced/assign-elements-to-layout-positions).

## Step 3. Set up the Chart
The compare chart is very flexible and allows you to not just set up the Data to be compare but Headers, Groups, Tools and more.

Locate and open the *ZOOcompare Chart / Compare* layout assignment view for the App and Type you have set up in the Step 1. For detailed information please review the [ZOO Positions Assignments](http://www.yootheme.com/zoo/documentation/advanced/assign-elements-to-layout-positions) and [Chart](ZOOcompare/chart.md) docs.

Drag & Drop the elements you would like to be bart of the comparison chart.

## Step 4. Set up the App instance
In the App Instance Configuration search for the ZOOcompare Tab and choose the Layout and the Max Items the user can compare, leave empty if there should be no limit.

## Step 5. Set up the Module. Optional.
Additionaly you could set up the ZOOcompare Module in order to list the user selected Items for comparison. Checkout it's [docs](ZOOcompare/module.md) for more details about it.

## Done!

The users can now select and compare the items!
