# Upgrading to v3

Due to the big changes made in ZOOcompare 3 the upgrade process is not possible, instead a clean installation must be performed uninstalling any previous version.
This documentation is for the 2.5.x version. The 3.x version installs in a similar manner; however, you CAN NOT do an upgrade of the 2.5.x version to the 3.x version. You MUST unisntall the 2.5.x version prior to installing the 3.x version.
YOU WILL loose comparison data during this process. Be sure to back up your data prior to this process, and we STRONGLY encourage you to install this new version on a test site first.
