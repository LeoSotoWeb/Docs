# Configuration

Our recommendation is to set your base or most common restrictions at the Type level, in the Element Config, and override them in the Layout Positions assignments as needed.

## Step 1. Set up the base access

Locate and edit the desired Type elements. Choose the Elements you would like to restrict the access and edit it's ZOOaccess section by clicking on the Evaluate checkbox. From the available rules choose and set the ones you would like to apply. For more details please review the [Elements Access](ZOOaccess/elements_access.md) and [Rules](ZOOaccess/rules.md) docs.

## Step 2. Tune up the access

Now that the base access is set we can override it completly or partially on each position. To do so go to the Positions Assignment view for the Layout you would like to work with and seek for the Element ZOOaccess section. Click on the *Override* box and set the specific param for this particular position.

You can also set the access to the Elements without base acces the same way you did in Step 1.

## Done!

Now your elements will be accessible only to the appropiate users.
