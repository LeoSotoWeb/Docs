# Open Graph

ZOOseo allows setting the Open Graph data using the *ZOOseo* Item Metadata layout.

![Open Graph](http://joolanders.github.io/Docs/docs/ZOOseo/images/opengraph.png)

- **Title** - the title of your page as it should appear within the graph.
- **Description** - a one to two sentence description of your page.
- **Type** - the type of your page, e.g., "video.movie". 
- **Image** - an image URL which should represent your page within the graph. ZOOseo will retrieve automatically the url from the image element.
- **Url** - the canonical URL of your page that will be used as its permanent ID in the graph, e.g., "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/".
- **Custom** - set custom OG properties using the element **Alternative label** to set the poperty type.
