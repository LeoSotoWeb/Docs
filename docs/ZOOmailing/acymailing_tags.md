# AcyMailing Tags

The AcyMailing ZOO Tag allows for including individual Items (Items Tab) or Items from a Category (Categories Tab). They are ment for different purposes and involves different configuration. Let's look at each one individually.

## Individual Items tag

The *Items* tab will allow you to insert specific ZOO items within your newsletter. This is often used when you are manually creating a standard newsletter, or when you need to insert a static ZOO item into a campaign or other automated newsletter.

### Filtering the available items

If you have a lot of ZOO items you might want to filter them down to locate the specific ZOO item you wish to insert. You can use the filtering settings in the top portion of the Items tab:

**Type** - Allows to choose the TYPE of item/s that you would like to insert into the newsletter (you can select multiple types here).
**Category** - Allows to choose the category that has the item/s you wish to include.
**Tag** - Select any tag/s to filter upon tags.
**Filter** - Enter any standard text to use to filter the ZOO item title.

Click the GO button to have the selected filters applied to the list of ZOO items. (Click Reset to clear any filtering you have applied).

### Setting the layout for the items

You can choose which ZOO layout should be used when the items are rendered and inserted into your newsletter.
