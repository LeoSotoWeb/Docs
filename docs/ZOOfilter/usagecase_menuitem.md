# Usage Case: Menu Item

There is a case when you would like to display a prefiltere list of ZOO items, without letting them actually refilter the list. ZOO doesn't come with that ability, and it might not be obvious, but with the ZOOfilter extension you CAN do that, and relatively easily.

## Step 1. Configure ZOOfilter

Follow the [ZOOfilter Configuration](ZOOfilter/configuration.md) doc to set up and display a list of Items filtered as desired. Then copy the URL of the result page.

## Step 2. Create the Menu Item

1. Go to the **Joomla Menu Manager** (*Joomla Administrator / Menus / Menu Manager*) and choose to edit the Menu where you would like to add a new Menu Item.
1. Create a new menu item of the type *External URL*.
1. In the link address area, paste the URL that you copied in Step 1.
1. Save your new menu item.

## Done!

That's is. Your new menu item should display the filtered results, without needing to display the module.
