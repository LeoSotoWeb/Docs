# Installing elements without the zoolandersmanager #

We encourage you to use the ZOOlandersManager to install all ZOOlanders elements and apps; however, if you run into problems with the Manager you can follow these instructions to manually install any element.

1. Open the Joomla Extension Manager (EXTENSIONS | EXTENSION MANAGER)
1. Click on the CHOOSE FILE button
1. Locate and select the install file which you downloaded onto your computer for the element/app that you are installing
1. Click the UPLOAD & INSTALL button

**If this is the first ZOOlander element that you are installing...**

1. Open the Joomla Plugin Manager (EXTENSIONS | PLUGIN MANAGER)
1. Locate the "ZOOlanders Elements" plugin (filter on "ZOO")
1. Set the "Zoolanders Elemetns" plugin status to 'enabled'
