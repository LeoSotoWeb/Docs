# Installing elements with the ZOOlandersManager #

We release updates often - don't miss out on new features! If you notice a problem in an element or think of a cool new feature - there's a good chance it's already there and you just don't have the latest version. Install the ZL Extensions Manager and you'll be able to quickly and easily see (and upgrade) your current ZOOlanders elements, apps, and other extensions as well as install any available elements, apps, or extensions*.
