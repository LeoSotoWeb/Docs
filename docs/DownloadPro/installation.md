# Installation

Installing the DownloadPro element is very easy:

1. Download the package from https://www.zoolanders.com/extensions/download-pro
2. Go to the Joomla Extensions Installer
3. Upload the previously downloaded DownloadPro package
4. Click Install and wait until the installation process will be finished

After this, the DownloadPro plugin should be installed and published. To be sure, go to ***Extensions / Plugin Manager*** and check if **ZLElements** is present and enabled.

### Quick Note
*DownloadPro is installed under the same plugin, **ZLElements**, as any other ZL Element, for perfomance reasons. If you want to check that DownloadPro is correctly installed, visit the ZOO configuration, and edit a type. If ImagePro shows up on the right section, then you're good to go!*
