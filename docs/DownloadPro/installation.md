# Installation

Installing the **DownloadPro** element is very easy:

1. Download the package from https://www.zoolanders.com/extensions/download-pro.
2. Go to the Joomla Extensions Installer: Joomla Admin CP -> Extensions -> Extension Manager.
3. Upload the previously downloaded DownloadPro package.
4. Click "Install" and wait until the installation process will be finished.

After this, the DownloadPro plugin should be installed and published. To be sure, go to ***Extensions / Plugin Manager*** and check if **ZLElements** is present and enabled.

### Quick Note
*DownloadPro is installed under the same plugin, ZLElements, as any other ZL Element for performance reasons. If you want to check that DownloadPro is installed correctly, visit the ZOO configuration and edit a type.
To do this click "gear" tab and click the link "Edit type elements" under any Type name. If DownloadPro shows up on the right section, then you're good to go!*
