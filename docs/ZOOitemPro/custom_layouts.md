# Custom Layouts

Creating custom layouts with ZOOitem Pro is very easy, just copy/paste the Default layout file and folder changing it's name to some custom name. After that you can start adapting the layout as you needed and even adapt it's params editing the *params.php* file. You can add your own CSS styles using the style.css example file (just be sure to uncomment the loading style line in the layout file) or just use your template CSS files.
