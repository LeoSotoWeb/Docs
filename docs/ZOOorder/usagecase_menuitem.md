# Usage Case: Menu Item

There is a case when you would like to display a list of ZOO items in a certain order, without letting them actually reorder the list.

ZOO doesn't come with that ability, and it might not be obvious, but with the ZOOorder extension you CAN do that, and relatively easily.

## Step 1. Configure ZOOorder

Follow the [ZOOorder Configuration](ZOOorder/configuration.md) doc to set up and display a list of Items ordered as desired. Then copy the URL of the result page.

## Step 2. Create the Menu Item

1. Go to the **Joomla Menu Manager** (*Joomla Administrator / Menus / Menu Manager*) and choose to edit the Menu where you would like to add a new Menu Item.
1. Create a new menu item of the type *External URL*.
1. In the link address area, paste the URL that you copied in Step 1.
1. Save your new menu item.

## Done!

That's is. Your new menu item should display the ordered results, without needing to display the module.
