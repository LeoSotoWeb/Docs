- **Mode**. 
You have three selections here: *Files, Folders, Both*.
	- **Files**: You can select ***just*** files from your disk (and upload them), one by one.
	- **Folders**: You can select ***just*** folders (but you can still upload files into the folders), one by one. The system will fetch the files contained in that folder automatically.
	- **Both**: You can select ***both*** files and folders (and still upload files). The system will merge the files from the folders and the files you selected in a single list.

- **Default Source**.
Default file for download. If no source is specified in the Item, the *specified default will be used on rendering*. Can be a full path to a *Folder or File*. 
If you input **[authorname]** in the path, it will be replaced with the item's author name.

- **Legal Extensions**.
This allows you to limit the extensions of files to those, indicated here. The default (bmp|gif|jgp|jpeg|png) will only allow files with these extensions to be uploaded. You can add, remove or replace this list if needed. Separate multiple file extensions with a 'pipe' `|` character (no spaces).
