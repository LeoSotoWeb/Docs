# Switching from ZOO <%= std %> to ZL <%= pro %>

If you have a site with a standard ZOO element, it would would be a lot of work to manually transfer the data to the Pro version. The good news is that you can switch in a few steps without loosing any data!

Follow the next steps and be sure you have [installed](<%= pro_link %>/installation.md) the *<%= pro %>* element.

**Note**: please backup before proceeding. ZOOlanders will not take any responsability of lost data.

1. Locate the *media / zoo / applications / [YOURAPP] / types / [YOURTYPE].config* file and open it for editing with any plain text editor.
1. Search for the param that relates to the specific element you are upgrading.
1. Locate the *type* entry for the element (it should be at the bottom of the specific element's section).
1. Change the *type* from `<%= std_type %>` to `<%= pro_type %>`.
1. Save the changes and return to your ZOO admin area.
1. Edit that same Type elements.
1. Locate and open the element that you are switching from. That element that was a *<%= std %>* element before should now be *<%= pro %>* element.
1. Open the Element options and [configure](<%= pro_link %>/configuration.md) it as needed.
1. Save the Type. Your entries should now be updated to use the *<%= pro %>* element.
